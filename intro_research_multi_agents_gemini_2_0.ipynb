        "In today's rapidly evolving technology landscape, businesses frequently need to conduct comprehensive research and analysis that spans multiple data sources, requires complex reasoning, and demands clear actionable insights. Whether it's market research, competitive analysis, urban planning, or scientific research, the challenges remain similar: how to efficiently gather, process, and synthesize information while ensuring accuracy and scalability.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Learning Through Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than using existing frameworks, we'll build our multi-agent system from scratch. This approach offers several benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Core Understanding**: Building from the ground up helps you understand the fundamental principles of multi-agent systems\n",
        "2. **Design Pattern Mastery**: Learn reusable patterns that work across different domains and technologies\n",
        "3. **Custom Control**: Gain the ability to fine-tune every aspect of your system\n",
        "4. **Debugging Confidence**: Understanding the internals makes troubleshooting much more straightforward\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are excellent open-source frameworks available for building multi-agent systems, such as [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI), [PydanticAI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai), and [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), we believe that a from-scratch approach in this notebook will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The open-source frameworks offers many valuable features like conditional routing, annotated global state, checkpointing, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you've grasped the fundamentals from this notebook, exploring these frameworks can unlock even more advanced capabilities and streamline your development process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Technical Components\n",
        "\n",
        "Our implementation showcases essential Vertex AI ***Gemini 2.0*** capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Function Calling**: Structure agent behaviors and interactions\n",
        "2. **Structured Output**: Generate consistent, validatable data\n",
        "3. **Async Operations**: Handle parallel agent tasks efficiently\n",
        "4. **Google Search Integration**: Ground agent reasoning in real-world data\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### To get started, let's explore some key questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* What exactly is an agent, and how does it differ from a simple LLM call?\n",
        "* How can agents use tools to achieve their goals?\n",
        "* And what possibilities emerge when multiple agents work together in a multi-agent system?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **LLM Execution (The Foundation)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of an LLM as a powerful prediction engine. Given some input text (a prompt), it predicts what comes next, generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way. However, on its own, it simply reacts to your input and provides an output. It doesn't have a sense of purpose or the ability to act independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** An LLM is like a super smart travel guidebook. You ask it \"What are some popular attractions in Paris?\" and it gives you a list. It provides information but doesn't actually do anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "![title](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/generative-ai/gemini2/use-cases/research_multi_agent_ev/img/simple-llm-flow.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Agent (LLM with a Purpose)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, imagine giving that prediction engine some goals and the ability to act on them. This is essentially what an agent is. It's an LLM wrapped with extra code that allows it to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Understand the goal:** \"Book a flight to London.\"\n",
        "* **Break it down into steps:** Search for flights, compare prices, choose a date, make a booking.\n",
        "* **Use tools to achieve those steps:** Access a flight booking API, a web browser, or even interact with a human.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** An agent is like a personal travel assistant. You tell it \"Plan a trip to Paris for me next month.\" The agent uses its LLM \"brain\" to understand what that means, then uses tools like flight booking websites, hotel search engines, and even weather apps to create an itinerary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "![title](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/generative-ai/gemini2/use-cases/research_multi_agent_ev/img/agent-flow.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Multi-Agent (Teamwork Makes the Dream Work)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, imagine several of these specialized agents working together, each with its own skills and responsibilities. That's a multi-agent system. They can communicate, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve a complex goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Now imagine a team of specialized travel agents working together. One agent books the flights, another finds the perfect hotel, a third arranges tours and activities. They communicate and coordinate to create an amazing Paris trip.\n",
        "\n",

        "**1. The \"Black Box\" Experience: Witnessing the Magic**\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine the entire multi-agent system as a single, powerful unit – the `EVAgent`. In this section, we'll treat it as a \"black box.\" You'll simply send it a research query, and watch as it works behind the scenes, delivering a comprehensive report in about 1-2 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll try two exciting examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Example 1: Basic Report Generation:**  See how the agent generates a structured report with predefined sections based on your query.\n",
        "*   **Example 2: Google Search Enhanced Report:** Observe how the agent leverages Google Search to enrich the report with citations, deeper insights, and up-to-the-minute information.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Planning:** Witness how the `PlanningAgent` crafts the initial research strategy. *We'll briefly touch upon the code behind this, highlighting the input it receives and the plan it outputs, along with the data models that structure this communication.*\n",
        "*   **Reasoning:** See how the `QueryAnalysisAgent` determines the necessary data and output format. *Again, we'll peek at the underlying code to understand its input, output, and the data models involved.*\n",
        "*   **Tool Selection:** Observe how the `DataGatherAgent` chooses the right APIs and leverages Google Search. *We'll examine the code's role in this selection process, focusing on the data models that guide its choices.*\n",
        "*   **Coordination:** Understand how the `ExecutionAgent` orchestrates the entire process. *We will shed some light on the code that enables this coordination, emphasizing the data models as the communication backbone between agents.*\n",
        "*   **Decision-Making:** Learn how the agents make choices at each step, leading to the final output.\n",

        "**A Note on Code Structure:**\n",
        "\n",
        "To keep this exploration clear and focused, the detailed code for each agent is neatly organized in separate files. **We are choosing not to put code directly in this notebook as it will make it unnecessarily complex.** So when we go through step by step, think of each agent as a black box. We will, however briefly talk about the design pattern it follows, what the data model it uses behind the scene to produce an output. Once you understand that, you can easily refer to the code from scratch or use any open-source library to implement a similar agent. Think of them as behind-the-scenes appendices you can explore later to dive deep into the implementation details of each agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The primary goal here is to showcase the power of agent collaboration with Gemini 2.0.** You'll witness how our team of Gemini-powered agents works together seamlessly to fulfill your research requests, demonstrating the elegance and efficiency of this multi-agent approach.\n"

              " 'report': {'combined_report': \"# EV Infrastructure Analysis Report: Austin, TX\\n\\nGenerated on May 10, 2025\\n\\n\\n## Executive Summary\\n\\nThis executive summary presents an analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure in Austin, Texas, focusing on charging availability and accessibility. Austin encompasses a total area of 1679.20 sq km [1], with a significant portion dedicated to water and green areas. The city's road network includes 1124 motorways [2] that support a substantial amount of traffic. An initial assessment reveals that the current EV charging infrastructure may require further expansion to adequately support a growing EV adoption rate within the city.\\n\\nCurrently, Austin has a total of 73 EV charging stations [3] to support an area of 586.14 square miles [4]. While the majority of stations offer public access (100%) [5] and a significant percentage provide 24/7 availability (75.3%) [6], the distribution and type of chargers available warrants attention. A considerable number of EV chargers are Level 2 (67 chargers) [7], with a smaller number of DC Fast Chargers (11 chargers) [8], which could lead to potential bottlenecks during peak charging times. In addition, most charging stations are part of ChargePoint Network (57.5%) [12], making most charging available with Credit Card (57.5%) [10] or Mobile Pay (64.4%) [11].\\n\\nConsidering the prevalence of apartments buildings (3773) [13], commercial (483) [14] and retail buildings (634) [15] within the city, strategic placement of additional EV charging stations should be considered in these areas to accommodate residents and visitors. As most charging stations have not been verified the last 90 days (0.0%) [16], investment in DC Fast Chargers is crucial to meet the demands of long-distance travelers. The availability of surface parking lots (2960) [9] presents opportunities for installing additional charging stations. Addressing these gaps will be essential to fostering greater EV adoption and reducing range anxiety among EV drivers in Austin.\\n\\n## Infrastructure Overview\\n\\n# Infrastructure Overview for EV Analysis in Austin, TX\\n\\nAustin, TX, presents a diverse infrastructure landscape that influences the deployment and utilization of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. The city's total area spans 1679.20 sq km [1], with a significant portion classified as water area at 654.29 sq km [2]. This leaves a considerable amount of land for development, including roadways and buildings, which are key factors in determining suitable locations for EV charging stations. The distribution of road types, from high-capacity motorways to residential streets, needs to be considered when planning EV infrastructure.\\n\\nThe current EV charging infrastructure in Austin includes a total of 73 stations [3] distributed across the city's 586.14 square miles [4]. The majority of these stations are Level 2 chargers, with 67 units installed, while DC Fast chargers are limited to 11 units [5]. This disparity indicates a potential need for increased investment in DC Fast charging infrastructure to support faster charging times and encourage broader EV adoption. Furthermore, almost all stations provide public access [6].\\n\\nKey aspects of the existing EV infrastructure include accessibility and network affiliations. A high percentage, 75.3%, of charging stations offer 24/7 access [7], which enhances convenience for EV users. While the vast majority of stations are free to use [8], most of them are part of the ChargePoint Network [9]. This could potentially limit the selection of charge stations for some users. Therefore, expansion of stations, and diversification of providers would improve EV adoption in the area.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Current EV Assessment\\n\\n# Current EV Infrastructure Assessment in Austin, TX\\n\\n## Executive Summary\\n\\nThis report assesses the current state of Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure in Austin, TX, focusing on charging capabilities, accessibility, and network distribution. The analysis identifies key strengths and areas for improvement to support the growing adoption of EVs within the city. With a total area of 1679.20 sq km [1], it's important to strategically place EV chargers for effective coverage and cater to the needs of the population. The city offers a varied mix of charging options and networks, and although a high percentage of EV chargers offer free charging options [7], expanding and diversifying will be key to meeting future demand.\\n\\n## Charging Infrastructure Overview\\n\\nAustin currently has a total of 73 EV charging stations [8] to service the city's 586.14 sq miles area [9]. The infrastructure primarily consists of Level 2 chargers, with 67 units available [10], and a smaller number of DC Fast Chargers, totaling 11 [11]. There are no Level 1 chargers in the area [12]. The distribution of charging capabilities highlights a need for increased investment in DC Fast Charging infrastructure to support faster charging times and accommodate longer trips. Considering the presence of 1124 motorways [2], strategic placement of these fast chargers along major transit corridors can improve the charging experience for EV drivers.\\n\\n## Accessibility and Network Analysis\\n\\nAccessibility to EV charging stations in Austin is high, with 100% of stations offering public access [5], and 75.3% providing 24/7 access [4]. The network landscape is dominated by ChargePoint Network, accounting for 57.5% of the stations [6]. However, a significant portion, 35.6%, are non-networked [6], presenting an opportunity for integration and standardization. A striking observation is that 98.6% of charging stations offer free charging [7], potentially hindering the long-term financial viability and maintenance of the infrastructure. Further, a large percentage, 100%, of the stations are more than 3 years old [13]. This raises concerns about the technology and upkeep, emphasizing the need for upgrades and modernization. While credit card payment is accepted at 57.5% of stations and mobile payment at 64.4% [3], diversifying payment options can enhance user convenience.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\nTo enhance EV infrastructure in Austin, the following steps should be considered:\\n\\n1.  **Expand DC Fast Charging Infrastructure:** Increase the availability of DC Fast Chargers, especially in areas with high traffic and near transport hubs. Aligning with the 2241 bus stops [14] could improve intermodal commuting options.\\n2.  **Modernize Existing Stations:** Upgrade older stations with the latest charging technology and payment options.\\n3.  **Promote Network Integration:** Encourage non-networked stations to join established networks for better management and user experience.\\n4.  **Implement Sustainable Pricing Models:** Introduce flexible and sustainable pricing models that ensure the long-term viability of the charging infrastructure. The presence of 272 parking structures and 2960 surface lots [15] also offers opportunities for installing a mix of charging stations.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Demand Analysis\\n\\n## EV Infrastructure Demand Analysis in Austin, TX\\n\\nThis report analyzes the demand for EV infrastructure in Austin, TX, based on available data points, focusing on charging capabilities and accessibility.

The charging network landscape is led by ChargePoint Network with 42 stations (57.5%) [9], while non-networked chargers make up a significant portion with 26 stations (35.6%) [10].\\n\\n### Charging Infrastructure Gaps and Opportunities\\n\\nGiven the total area of Austin being 1679.20 sq km [11], with 647.89 sq km [12] of built area where most buildings like apartments (3773) [13] are concentrated, there's a potential need for additional charging stations, particularly in residential areas. While 98.6% of the charging is free [14], it is possible that introducing reasonable fee rates can cover maintenance costs and incentivizes further infrastructure investment. The current number of DC Fast Chargers (11) is low and increased deployment of fast chargers would address range anxiety concerns and support long-distance travel within and through the city. Furthermore, with more than 13198 residential roads [15], having more Level 2 chargers within those districts makes EV usage feasible for overnight charging.\\n\\n### Recommendations and Strategic Implications\\n\\nBased on the current EV infrastructure landscape, strategic recommendations can be formulated to meet the growing demand and address existing gaps. Increasing the number of DC Fast Chargers, especially along major transportation corridors (1124 motorways [16]), should be a priority. Focusing on residential areas with a high concentration of apartments and houses is recommended to boost charging in these areas, and providing incentives to install Level 2 chargers in these spots would likely boost EV ownership. Exploring flexible pricing models with potential paid options while retaining some free services can support infrastructure maintenance and expansion. These strategic implications aim to ensure that Austin's EV infrastructure adequately supports the growing EV adoption rate, contributing to a more sustainable transportation ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n## Supply Analysis\\n\\nThe supply analysis for EV infrastructure in Austin, TX reveals a nascent but growing network. Austin has a total area of 1679.20 sq km [1], and a significant portion of the city's built area is 647.89 sq km [2], indicating a high potential demand for EV charging within urban zones. The city offers a total of 73 EV charging stations [3]. While the infrastructure is publicly accessible [7], most stations are Level 2 chargers (67 chargers) [5], with significantly fewer DC Fast Chargers (11 chargers) [4].\\n\\nAnalysis of the EV charging network reveals that 57.5% [11] of the stations are part of the ChargePoint Network, while a notable 35.6% [12] are non-networked. Tesla chargers account for only 6.8% [13] of the total stations, suggesting that Tesla owners might experience limited options outside of Tesla's proprietary infrastructure. A striking 98.6% [14] of the charging is free, with only 1.4% [15] being paid. It may skew investment in charging infrastructure since revenue generation from charging services is minimal. The availability of 475 EV charging spots in parking locations [6], the city has 272 parking structures [9], suggesting an opportunity to expand EV charging within these existing structures.\\n\\nFurthermore, data regarding station age shows that a high percentage, 100.0% [16], of EV charging stations are more than 3 years old. This could suggest that the charging infrastructure in Austin needs modernization. The 2241 bus stops [8] in Austin represents a strategic point of opportunity to integrate charging facilities. It's worth noting that 57.5% [17] of the charging stations have been verified in the last 30 days. Austin contains 3773 apartment buildings [10]. Apartment buildings with EV charging stations represents a significant potential for EV adoption.\\n\\n## Gap Analysis\\n\\nA gap analysis of Austin, TX's EV infrastructure reveals several key areas needing attention to support growing EV adoption. While public access to charging stations is universally available [10], the distribution and capabilities of these stations present challenges. The city spans a total area of 1679.20 sq km [1] with a built area of 647.89 sq km [4], but the current EV charging infrastructure is limited. The majority of the stations (57.5%) are part of the ChargePoint Network [11], with a substantial number (35.6%) being non-networked [12]. Furthermore, almost all (98.6%) charging stations offer free charging [13], which may not be sustainable in the long term as EV adoption increases and demand surges.\\n\\nAustin's charging infrastructure relies heavily on Level 2 chargers.  There are 67 Level 2 chargers and 11 DC Fast Chargers [6]. This imbalance indicates a need for more rapid charging options to accommodate longer trips and reduce charging times.  The city has 13 bus stations and 10 train stations [5]. These could represent strategic locations for increased charger deployment. Austin has 3773 apartments and 159 residential buildings [3] that may lack adequate at-home EV infrastructure.  Additionally, 57.5% of stations accept credit cards, and 64.4% support mobile payments [9], indicating good but not complete coverage for payment convenience.\\n\\nActionable steps to bridge these gaps include incentivizing the installation of more DC Fast Chargers, especially in high-traffic areas and near transportation hubs. A sustainable charging model should be explored, moving beyond the current reliance on free charging. Investment in charging infrastructure at apartment complexes can alleviate challenges for renters.  Also, a significant portion (42.5%) of EV stations have not been verified in the last 30 days [14], thus ensuring frequent verification and maintenance of existing charging stations will also be crucial. Furthermore, a small number of Tesla chargers, only 6.8% of the total [12], hints at a potential for partnerships to expand the Tesla network and improve charger coverage.\\n\\n## Location Recommendations\\n\\nAustin, TX, presents a unique landscape for EV infrastructure development. While the city boasts a total area of 1679.20 sq km [1], only 647.89 sq km is built area [2], suggesting potential for strategic placement of charging stations in currently undeveloped zones. The city's extensive road network, including 13198 residential roads [3] and 42711 service roads [4], indicates a significant need for accessible charging options in residential and commercial areas. Furthermore, with 2241 bus stops [5] and a considerable number of apartments totaling 3773 [6], focusing on these high-traffic and residential density locations could maximize the utilization of new EV charging infrastructure.\\n\\nCurrently, Austin has 73 EV charging stations covering 586.14 sq miles [7]. Of these, the majority are Level 2 chargers (67) [8], while DC Fast chargers are limited (11) [9]. This disparity highlights a need for expanding DC Fast charging infrastructure to accommodate the increasing demand for quick charging, especially considering the large number of motorways (1124) [10] where drivers may want to quickly charge during transit. Accessibility is good, with 75.3% having 24/7 access [11], and public access at 100% [12], but there is room for improvement in payment options, with only 57.5% accepting credit cards [13] and 64.4% accepting mobile pay [14], thus increasing the availability of payment options could improve adoption.\\n\\nThe EV charging network in Austin is dominated by ChargePoint Network (57.5%) [15], followed by Non-Networked chargers (35.6%) [16]. Interestingly, the vast majority (98.6%) of charging is free [17]. This pricing model may not be sustainable long-term with increased EV adoption. Furthermore, the age of the stations is also a consideration, with 100% being more than 3 years old [18]. Given the increasing pace of EV technology, the current infrastructure could be aging, thus calling for infrastructure upgrades.\\n\\n\\n## Implementation Strategy\\n\\n# EV Infrastructure Analysis in Austin, TX\\n\\n## Executive Summary\\nThis report analyzes the existing Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure in Austin, TX, focusing on charging capabilities, accessibility, network distribution, and station age.

Considering the presence of 1124 motorways [2], strategic placement of these fast chargers along major transit corridors can improve the charging experience for EV drivers.\\n\\n## Accessibility and Network Analysis\\n\\nAccessibility to EV charging stations in Austin is high, with 100% of stations offering public access [5], and 75.3% providing 24/7 access [4]. The network landscape is dominated by ChargePoint Network, accounting for 57.5% of the stations [6]. However, a significant portion, 35.6%, are non-networked [6], presenting an opportunity for integration and standardization. A striking observation is that 98.6% of charging stations offer free charging [7], potentially hindering the long-term financial viability and maintenance of the infrastructure. Further, a large percentage, 100%, of the stations are more than 3 years old [13]. This raises concerns about the technology and upkeep, emphasizing the need for upgrades and modernization. While credit card payment is accepted at 57.5% of stations and mobile payment at 64.4% [3], diversifying payment options can enhance user convenience.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\nTo enhance EV infrastructure in Austin, the following steps should be considered:\\n\\n1.  **Expand DC Fast Charging Infrastructure:** Increase the availability of DC Fast Chargers, especially in areas with high traffic and near transport hubs. Aligning with the 2241 bus stops [14] could improve intermodal commuting options.\\n2.  **Modernize Existing Stations:** Upgrade older stations with the latest charging technology and payment options.\\n3.  **Promote Network Integration:** Encourage non-networked stations to join established networks for better management and user experience.\\n4.  **Implement Sustainable Pricing Models:** Introduce flexible and sustainable pricing models that ensure the long-term viability of the charging infrastructure. The presence of 272 parking structures and 2960 surface lots [15] also offers opportunities for installing a mix of charging stations.\\n\\n\", citations={1: CitationData(number=1, value='1679.20', data_path='summary.area_metrics.total_area_sqkm', raw_value='1679.20', context='Total area of Austin in sq km'), 2: CitationData(number=2, value='1124', data_path='summary.roads.motorways', raw_value='1124', context='Number of motorways in Austin'), 3: CitationData(number=3, value='64.4', data_path='ev_data.accessibility.payment_methods.mobile_pay.percentage', raw_value='64.4', context='Percentage of stations accepting mobile pay'), 4: CitationData(number=4, value='75.3', data_path='ev_data.accessibility.access_type.24_7_access.percentage', raw_value='75.3', context='Percentage of stations with 24/7 access'), 5: CitationData(number=5, value='100.0', data_path='ev_data.accessibility.access_type.public.percentage', raw_value='100.0', context='Percentage of stations with public access'), 6: CitationData(number=6, value='57.5', data_path='ev_data.network_analysis.networks', raw_value='57.5', context='ChargePoint Network percentage'), 7: CitationData(number=7, value='98.6', data_path='ev_data.network_analysis.pricing.free', raw_value='98.6', context='percentage of EV chargers are free'), 8: CitationData(number=8, value='73', data_path='ev_data.metadata.total_stations', raw_value='73', context='Total number of EV charging stations'), 9: CitationData(number=9, value='586.14', data_path='ev_data.metadata.city_area_square_miles', raw_value='586.14', context='City area in square miles'), 10: CitationData(number=10, value='67', data_path='ev_data.charging_capabilities.by_type.level2', raw_value='67', context='Number of Level 2 chargers'), 11: CitationData(number=11, value='11', data_path='ev_data.charging_capabilities.by_type.dc_fast', raw_value='11', context='Number of DC Fast Chargers'), 12: CitationData(number=12, value='0', data_path='ev_data.charging_capabilities.by_type.level1', raw_value='0', context='Number of Level 1 chargers'), 13: CitationData(number=13, value='100.0', data_path='ev_data.station_age.age_distribution.more_than_3_years.percentage', raw_value='100.0', context='Percentage of stations over 3 years old'), 14: CitationData(number=14, value='2241', data_path='summary.transport.bus_stops', raw_value='2241', context='Number of bus stops in Austin'), 15: CitationData(number=15, value='272', data_path='summary.parking.parking_structures', raw_value='272', context='Number of parking structures')}, key_findings=['Dominance of Level 2 chargers necessitates expansion of DC Fast Charging infrastructure.', 'High percentage of free charging stations may impact long-term financial sustainability.', 'Aging infrastructure requires modernization and technological upgrades.'], enhanced_content=None),\n",

It considers the current infrastructure and identifies potential areas for improvement and expansion.\\n\\n### Current EV Infrastructure Landscape\\n\\nAustin currently has a total of 73 EV charging stations [1] within a city area of 586.14 square miles [2]. The distribution of chargers consists predominantly of Level 2 chargers, with 67 units available [3], alongside 11 DC Fast Chargers [4]. It's crucial to note that there are no Level 1 chargers available in the area [5]. The vast majority (75.3%) of these stations offer 24/7 access [6], and 100% are publicly accessible [7]. Payment options are dominated by credit card (57.5%) and mobile pay (64.4%) [8]. The charging network landscape is led by ChargePoint Network with 42 stations (57.5%) [9], while non-networked chargers make up a significant portion with 26 stations (35.6%) [10].\\n\\n### Charging Infrastructure Gaps and Opportunities\\n\\nGiven the total area of Austin being 1679.20 sq km [11], with 647.89 sq km [12] of built area where most buildings like apartments (3773) [13] are concentrated, there's a potential need for additional charging stations, particularly in residential areas. While 98.6% of the charging is free [14], it is possible that introducing reasonable fee rates can cover maintenance costs and incentivizes further infrastructure investment. The current number of DC Fast Chargers (11) is low and increased deployment of fast chargers would address range anxiety concerns and support long-distance travel within and through the city. Furthermore, with more than 13198 residential roads [15], having more Level 2 chargers within those districts makes EV usage feasible for overnight charging.\\n\\n### Recommendations and Strategic Implications\\n\\nBased on the current EV infrastructure landscape, strategic recommendations can be formulated to meet the growing demand and address existing gaps. Increasing the number of DC Fast Chargers, especially along major transportation corridors (1124 motorways [16]), should be a priority. Focusing on residential areas with a high concentration of apartments and houses is recommended to boost charging in these areas, and providing incentives to install Level 2 chargers in these spots would likely boost EV ownership. Exploring flexible pricing models with potential paid options while retaining some free services can support infrastructure maintenance and expansion. These strategic implications aim to ensure that Austin's EV infrastructure adequately supports the growing EV adoption rate, contributing to a more sustainable transportation ecosystem.\\n\", citations={1: CitationData(number=1, value='73', data_path='ev_data.metadata.total_stations', raw_value='73', context='Total number of EV charging stations in Austin'), 2: CitationData(number=2, value='586.14', data_path='ev_data.metadata.city_area_square_miles', raw_value='586.14', context='City area in square miles'), 3: CitationData(number=3, value='67', data_path='ev_data.charging_capabilities.by_type.level2', raw_value='67', context='Number of Level 2 chargers'), 4: CitationData(number=4, value='11', data_path='ev_data.charging_capabilities.by_type.dc_fast', raw_value='11', context='Number of DC Fast Chargers'), 5: CitationData(number=5, value='0', data_path='ev_data.charging_capabilities.by_type.level1', raw_value='0', context='Number of Level 1 chargers'), 6: CitationData(number=6, value='75.3', data_path='ev_data.accessibility.access_type.24_7_access.percentage', raw_value='75.3', context='Percentage of stations with 24/7 access'), 7: CitationData(number=7, value='100.0', data_path='ev_data.accessibility.access_type.public.percentage', raw_value='100.0', context='Percentage of stations with public access'), 8: CitationData(number=8, value='57.5', data_path='ev_data.accessibility.payment_methods.credit_card.percentage', raw_value='57.5', context='Percentage of stations accepting credit cards'), 9: CitationData(number=9, value='42', data_path='ev_data.network_analysis.networks[0].count', raw_value='42', context='Number of ChargePoint Network stations'), 10: CitationData(number=10, value='26', data_path='ev_data.network_analysis.networks[1].count', raw_value='26', context='Number of non-networked chargers'), 11: CitationData(number=11, value='1679.20', data_path='summary.area_metrics.total_area_sqkm', raw_value='1679.20', context='Total area of Austin in sq km'), 12: CitationData(number=12, value='647.89', data_path='summary.area_metrics.built_area_sqkm', raw_value='647.89', context='Built area of Austin in sq km'), 13: CitationData(number=13, value='3773', data_path='summary.buildings.apartments', raw_value='3773', context='Number of apartments in Austin'), 14: CitationData(number=14, value='98.6', data_path='ev_data.network_analysis.pricing.free.value', raw_value='98.6', context='Percentage of free charging stations'), 15: CitationData(number=15, value='13198', data_path='summary.roads.residential', raw_value='13198', context='Number of residential roads'), 16: CitationData(number=16, value='1124', data_path='summary.roads.motorways', raw_value='1124', context='Number of motorways')}, key_findings=['Predominance of Level 2 chargers indicates a need for more DC Fast Chargers.', 'High concentration of apartments and residential roads suggest a need for more stations within residential areas.', 'Limited pricing options present opportunities for implementing flexible pricing models.'], enhanced_content=None),\n",

While you can still perform grounding with search, the output format and structure cannot be explicitly controlled at this time. Controlled generation is important for grounding as it allows us to specify the desired format and structure of the output, ensuring that the information retrieved from web search is integrated into the report in a consistent and organized manner. In the meantime, we are utilizing the Gemini 2.0 model to perform grounding with controlled generation capabilities. You can explore examples of grounding with google search as a Tool Gemini 2.0 (without controlled generation) [here](link)."

        "> \"The existing EV charging infrastructure, while growing, needs significant expansion to meet the rising demand for EVs. Currently, there are 78 total EV charging stations [2] across the city. This number is significantly lower than other major cities with similar populations. **A recent study by BloombergNEF [3] highlights the need for a much higher density of charging stations to support widespread EV adoption.**\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Here's the impact:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **External Validation:** The original content stated that Austin's charging station count is low compared to similar cities. The enhanced content, using the BloombergNEF report found via Google Search, adds external validation to this claim. It's no longer just an observation based on our data; it's now supported by a reputable source on global EV trends.\n",
        "2. **Strategic Depth:** The BloombergNEF citation adds a layer of strategic depth. It's not just about the current number of stations; it connects to the broader concept of \"charging station density\" needed for \"widespread EV adoption\" – a key insight for planning Austin's EV future.\n",
        "3. **Credibility Boost:** Referencing a well-known organization like BloombergNEF significantly enhances the credibility of the report. It demonstrates that our analysis is informed by industry experts and best practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In essence, Google Search, through this specific citation, helped us transform a simple observation into a well-supported, strategically relevant insight.** It demonstrates how our system leverages web knowledge to enhance the report's quality, moving beyond the limitations of our initial data and providing a more nuanced and impactful analysis. This dynamic integration of external information is a key strength of our multi-agent approach."

        "Let's explore the visualizations generated from the raw API data, which offer a deeper understanding of Austin's EV infrastructure and its urban context. The code uses the `create_comprehensive_city_analysis` function to produce a set of Plotly figures, each shedding light on different aspects of the city:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. EV Infrastructure Overview Dashboard:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Charging Station Types:** This bar chart breaks down the number of DC Fast, Level 2, and Level 1 charging stations. For Austin, it highlights the dominance of Level 2 chargers and the relative scarcity of DC Fast chargers. This is crucial for understanding the current charging landscape and identifying potential gaps, especially for users requiring faster charging options.\n",
        "*   **Connector Distribution:** This pie chart reveals the types of connectors available (e.g., CCS, CHAdeMO, Tesla). By examining this chart for Austin, you can assess the compatibility of the existing infrastructure with various EV models.\n",
        "*   **Network Distribution:** This bar chart displays the number of charging stations associated with different networks (e.g., ChargePoint, Tesla). For Austin, it might reveal a reliance on a particular network, which could influence decisions about network diversification and partnerships.\n",
        "*   **Access & Payment Methods:** This bar chart shows the percentage of stations offering various access and payment methods (e.g., credit card, mobile pay, 24/7 access). In Austin's case, it can indicate the ease of use and accessibility of the charging infrastructure for different users.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Transportation Infrastructure Analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Public Transport Facilities:** This section visualizes the number of bus stops, train stations, bus stations, and bike rental locations. For Austin, this data helps assess the integration of EV charging with existing public transportation, which is vital for planning intermodal hubs.\n",
        "*   **Road Network Distribution:** This shows the distribution of motorways, primary, secondary, and residential roads. Understanding Austin's road network density and types can inform decisions about optimal charging station placement along major thoroughfares.\n",
        "*   **Parking Facilities:** This section charts the number of surface parking lots, parking structures, street parking spaces, and designated EV charging spots. For Austin, it helps evaluate the availability of parking spaces that could potentially be equipped with EV charging.\n",
        "*   **EV vs. Traditional Infrastructure:** This compares the number of EV charging stations, fuel stations, car dealerships, and car repair shops. In Austin's context, it provides insights into the current balance between EV and traditional vehicle infrastructure, indicating the progress of EV adoption.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Urban Amenities and Services:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Retail and Shopping:** This visualizes the distribution of shopping centers, supermarkets, department stores, and convenience stores. For Austin, it helps identify potential locations for charging stations near high-traffic retail areas.\n",
        "*   **Food and Entertainment:** This section charts restaurants, cafes, bars, and fast-food outlets. Understanding the density of these amenities in Austin can guide the placement of charging stations near popular destinations.\n",
        "*   **Emergency Services:** This displays the number of police stations, fire stations, hospitals, and clinics. For Austin, this information can be relevant for ensuring the resilience of the EV infrastructure and planning for emergency response related to EVs.\n",
        "*   **Public Amenities:** This visualizes the number of post offices, banks, ATMs, and public toilets. In Austin's context, it helps assess the availability of essential services near potential charging station locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Area Analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Area Distribution:** This pie chart shows the breakdown of Austin's total area into water, green, built, and other areas. It provides a quick overview of the city's land use, which can be a factor in determining suitable locations for charging infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ideally, these charts would be integrated into the report itself, providing a visual complement to the textual analysis.** However, even as standalone visualizations, they offer valuable insights for decision-making related to EV charging station expansion. For example, by examining the distribution of charging types, connector types, and network providers, along with the city's transportation infrastructure and urban amenities, stakeholders can identify strategic locations for new charging stations, optimize the mix of charging options, and ensure that the expansion aligns with the city's overall development and EV adoption trends. By correlating the density of public transportation, road networks, and parking facilities with the location of existing EV charging stations, planners can pinpoint areas where additional infrastructure is most needed. They can also consider factors such as proximity to retail centers, food and entertainment venues, and public amenities to enhance the user experience and maximize the utilization of charging stations."

It uses the `plotly` library to generate various charts and graphs that help to understand the EV infrastructure landscape in a more visual and intuitive manner. Although it's called an \"agent\" here, it's important to note that this is essentially a set of helper functions for creating visualizations rather than an autonomous agent with decision-making capabilities.\n",

        "    *   **EV Infrastructure Overview:** Bar charts showing charging station types, connector distribution, network distribution, and access & payment methods.\n",
        "    *   **Transportation Infrastructure Analysis:** A multi-panel plot showing public transport facilities, road network distribution, parking facilities, and a comparison of EV vs. traditional vehicle infrastructure.\n",
        "    *   **Urban Amenities and Services:** A multi-panel plot showing the distribution of retail and shopping centers, food and entertainment venues, emergency services, and public amenities.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Multi-City Comparisons (if applicable):** If the input data contains information for multiple cities, it uses the `plot_multi_city_comparison` function to generate comparative visualizations. These include:\n",
        "    *   **EV Infrastructure Comparisons:** Bar charts comparing the number of EV stations vs. fuel stations, charging station types, and EV station density across cities.\n",
        "    *   **Transportation Infrastructure:** Bar charts comparing public transport infrastructure, road network distribution, and parking facilities across cities.\n",
        "    *   **Area Analysis:** A bar chart comparing area distribution (total, water, green, built) across cities.\n",

        "The `VisualizeAgent` plays a crucial role in making the data more accessible and understandable by providing a visual representation of key metrics and trends. These visualizations can aid in identifying patterns, making comparisons, and ultimately supporting decision-making related to EV infrastructure planning and development."

        "3. **Expanded Tool Integration:** Integrate with more APIs, databases, web scraping, and knowledge graphs to broaden the system's knowledge base.\n",
        "4. **Interactive User Experience:** Allow for clarification dialogs, progress updates, interactive visualizations, and user feedback mechanisms.\n",
        "5. **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive exception handling, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies for increased reliability.\n",
        "6. **Integrated Visualizations:** Incorporate visualizations directly into the generated reports for a more cohesive and engaging presentation.\n",
        "7. **Agent Memory and Learning:** Introduce agent memory for caching, learning from user feedback, and potential model fine-tuning to improve performance over time.\n",
